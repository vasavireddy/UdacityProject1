			<h3>Clipper</h3>
			<p>Mobile Application</p>
			<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Jenny Ng, Vani Mehta, and Vasavi Reddy</p>
			<p><strong>My Role:</strong> User Experience and Visual Design</p>
			<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Adding money on to your Clipper card can be a long and confusing process. My team and I decided to create a mobile application to simplify this process.</p>

			<h4>The Research Phase</h4>
			<p>We first started tackling this problem by viewing the current Clipper card payment process for different transit services. We soon realized how convoluted the data got, as different transit services had different buckets on your Clipper Card.</p>
			<p>We then viewed several forums online, and talked to various Clipper card users to try to understand their frustrations with the current process. Using their feedback, we went into creating user flows that simplified the current payment process.</p>

			<h4>The Ideation Phase</h4>
			<p> From here, my partners and I went into many sketch sessions. We would all seperately sketch out our ideas and then come together to combine them. Once we flushed out all of our ideas, we went into creating our initial wireframes and prototype.</p>

			<h4>The Iteration Phase</h4>
			<p>Using our prototype, we conducted a lot of usability testing to get an idea of what was working within the app and what wasn't. We got a lot of great feedback, and using this information, we decided to take a new route and went back to sketching, wireframing, and prototyping.</p>
			<p>After iterating on our initial wirefames and prototype, we conducted more usability testing. Using the feedback from this round of testing, we went back and made more changes to our wireframes.</p>

			<h4>Reflection and Next Steps</h4>
			<!--<p>The main lesson I learned from this project was that what is logical to me isn't necessarily what seems logical to others. Everyone has their own thought processes and own desired ways to perform actions. By soliciting feedback at every stage in the process, I was able to get a clear idea of what users preferred and iterate my prototype to help users have a more seamless way of browsing an online toy store. For the future, I will be even more aggressive when it comes to creating feedback loops, as the constant lessons learned from users was pivotal in creating a better user experience.</p>-->
