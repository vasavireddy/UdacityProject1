			<h3>General Assembly Project</h3>
			<h3>My Role</h3>
			<p>User Experience and Visual Design</p>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>For the Visual Design class at General Assembly, we were asked to create a landing page for a website and mobile application for any problem we wanted to solve. I wanted to create an app where you could essentially take a picture of any clothing piece, and the app would give you a curated list of places where you can purchase that item or similar items.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<hr>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<h4>The Research Phase</h4>
			<p>I wanted the website and mobile app to be strong like other fashion brands, but wanted a warm, friendly feeling to it as well. Viewing various fashion bloggers and fashion websites, I put together a collection of images for my moodboard.</p>
			<p>From here, I went into choosing the right typeface for my project. After much research, I decided upon the typeface 'Proxima Nova', as I felt it conveyed the emotions I wanted users to feel when viewing the app.</p>

			<h5>SnapIt Moodboard</h5>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<hr>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<h4>The Ideation Phase</h4>
			<p> I next started thinking about the layout of my website and app. I created sketches and low-fidelity wireframes of the landing page for the website and home screen for the mobile app. After getting feedback on the different layouts, I went into creating high-fidelity wireframes and mockups.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit3.png">
			<h5>Landing Page: Option 1</h5>
			<p>For the landing page, I wanted to keep it simple and show just the information that was needed. For one layout, it shows the 3 steps to the SnapIt process one after another.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit4.png">
			<h5>Landing Page: Option 2</h5>
			<p>For the second option, the 3 steps are shown all at once on the page. This way, the users can get all the pertinent information at once.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit5.png">
			<h5>Log In Screen</h5>
			<p>The log in screen will be very simple, with only 2 actions: log in and sign up.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit6.png">
			<h5>Home Screen</h5>
			<p>In the home screen, there will be a camera button, which when clicked on, takes you to your camera to take a picture of the fashion item.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<hr>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<h4>The Iteration Phase</h4>
			<p>Once I finished with my initial mockups, I sought out feedback for the layout, color, and imagery for the different landing pages and for the home screen.</p>
			<p>Using the feedback that I received, I went back and made changes to my initial mockup screens. Once I completed this, I started thinking of the branding of my product.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit7.png">
			<h5>Landing Page: Option 1</h5>
			<p>The top half of the landing page has an image that represents the app, and then goes into the three steps of the SnapIt process.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit8.png">
			<h5>Landing Page: Option 1</h5>
			<p>The bottom half of the landing page will have an area for users to sign up for SnapIt.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit9.png">
			<h5>Landing Page: Option 2</h5>
			<p>The second option for the landing page is similar to option 1, except that the 3 steps are shown all at once, horizontally on the page.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit10.png">
			<h5>Log-In Screen</h5>
			<p>The log-in screen will have a solid background with just the two actions shown: log-in and sign up.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit11.png">
			<h5>Home Screen</h5>
			<p>The home screen shows two different actions: the camera icon, which will take the user into the camera function to take a picture and an area to see your most recent pictures.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit12.png">
			<h5>Hamburger Menu</h5>
			<p>Under the hamburger menu is where all the secondary actions will fall. You will be able to view your profile, settings and past pictures taken.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<hr>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<h4>Reflection and Next Steps</h4>
			<p>The main lesson I learned from this project was that what is logical to me isn't necessarily what seems logical to others. Everyone has their own thought processes and own desired ways to perform actions. By soliciting feedback at every stage in the process, I was able to get a clear idea of what users preferred and iterate my prototype to help users have a more seamless way of browsing an online toy store. For the future, I will be even more aggressive when it comes to creating feedback loops, as the constant lessons learned from users was pivotal in creating a better user experience.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit13.png">
			<h5>Landing Page</h5>
			<p>Talking to users, I found that there was a lot of empty space on the landing page, so I added an opaque layer to the cover image and added a tagline and area for users to sign up.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit14.png">
			<h5>Log-In Screen</h5>
			<p>The previous iteration of the log-in screen had a solid background, which felt very bare. For this reason, I added an image to the background to add more personality to the app, drawing in more users.</p>
			<span style="display:inline-block; width: YOURWIDTH;"></span>
			<img src="portfolio/img/snapit15.png">
			<h5>Home Screen</h5>
			<p>In the previous iteration, the user had to click on the camera icon to get into the camera. Seeing as taking a picture is the most important function, I decided that it would make more sense for the app to directly open up to the camera.</p>
